We divvied up the work based on general intelligence; Sir Micheal was responsible for clicking a simple button, and Liam "The Chief" O'Keeffe took on the task of creating our html and css files for the output of our scraping. 

### Back End Work

Sir Micheal started toiling away in the kit of script, and made excellent progress. He got to the point of autofilling the email for the google login screen, and clicking the next button. YAY!!! With his wizardry he also was able to autofill the password, but alas ran into trouble clicking the submit password button...

### Front End Work

The Chief worked his magic saucing up three beutiful html templates. One for the "assignment mode", another for "grade mode" and the last for "overview". All was commited and when class ended we were still hopeful.
